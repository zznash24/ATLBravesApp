# ATLBravesApp

In this App 

    I have used Bootstrap to Style and create nav tab at the top of the screen

    Simply click on a tab that you want to see an outcome for: 

    the tabs are broke down into HomeRuns, Singles, Doubles, and Outs.

    Using an excel file
        I parsed the data into Json Array
        Then using that simplified array I could extract certain information from plates apperances

    **This App was a lot of fun to make for me becuase I, Myself have played baseball my whole life until I torn my shoulder. I even won a national championship in college (i have a ring to prove it)**
